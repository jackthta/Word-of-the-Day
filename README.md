# Word of the Day
This is a single page web application that shows you what the word of the day is. This project was built using HTML5, (no styling was applied yet), ReactJS, Redux, Firebase, Webpack and dependencies listed in package.json. The word is fetched from the Oxford Dictionary's API. I attempted to add Firebase's authentication so that users can create accounts to save words that they like as well as Firebase's real-time database so that users can see a list of what words they saved in the past.

Note:
- **There are some holes in this application, but the application works at a very base level.**

## Showcase
Showcase will come after styling has been applied.
